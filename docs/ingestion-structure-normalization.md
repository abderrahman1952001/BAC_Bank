# Ingestion Structure Normalization

## Purpose

This document defines the default normalization rules for manually reviewed BAC
paper ingestion drafts.

Use these rules for new imports so drafts do not drift by operator habit.
There is no single universal hierarchy that fits all BAC papers across all
subjects and years. Infer the hierarchy from the visible labels, ordering, and
grouping in the source paper.

Prefer a faithful semantic structure over flattening everything into
`EXERCISE -> QUESTION`.

This is especially important for subjects where one exercise may contain:

- direct sibling questions
- named parts such as `الجزء الأول`
- nested subquestions under a numbered question

## Current Policy

Apply this normalization from now on for new structured imports and draft
cleanups.

Earlier drafts may stay as-is temporarily, but they should be backfilled toward
the same shape before large-scale publication.

## Available Node Types And Hierarchy Inference

The draft model already supports:

- `EXERCISE`
- `PART`
- `QUESTION`
- `SUBQUESTION`
- `CONTEXT`

Use them as follows.

The supported node types are fixed, but the nesting order is paper-dependent.
Common shapes include:

- `EXERCISE -> PART -> QUESTION -> SUBQUESTION`
- `PART -> EXERCISE -> QUESTION -> SUBQUESTION`
- `EXERCISE -> QUESTION -> SUBQUESTION`
- other clearly evidenced shapes from the paper

Do not force one template onto every subject or year.

### `EXERCISE`

Use one `EXERCISE` node per visible exercise in the paper.

An `EXERCISE` may be:

- a root node under the variant
- a child of a top-level `PART` when the paper is organized by parts first

Examples:

- `التمرين الأول`
- `التمرين الثاني`

### `PART`

Use `PART` when the paper clearly introduces a structural subdivision that
contains multiple child prompts, questions, or a shared statement.

Typical triggers:

- `الجزء الأول`
- `الجزء الثاني`
- Roman section labels at the start of a line, such as `I`, `II`, `III`
- a clearly separated named section inside the exercise

A `PART` may be:

- a child of an `EXERCISE`
- a root node under the variant when the whole paper is split into major parts
  before exercises appear

Do **not** create a `PART` for every decorative heading. If the heading is only
stylistic and does not actually organize child nodes, keep it in blocks.

### `QUESTION`

Use `QUESTION` for the main numbered prompts in an exercise or part.

Default rule:

- numbered items like `1`, `2`, `3`, `4` are `QUESTION` nodes

Questions may appear:

- directly under `EXERCISE`
- under `PART`
- under the nearest structurally correct parent shown by the paper

### `SUBQUESTION`

Use `SUBQUESTION` for prompts nested under a numbered question.

Default rule:

- lettered items like `أ`, `ب`, `ج`, `د` are `SUBQUESTION` nodes only when
  they are clearly nested under a numbered question

`SUBQUESTION` should normally live under a `QUESTION`.

If lettered prompts appear directly under an `EXERCISE` or `PART`, and there is
no parent numbered question introducing them, treat them as `QUESTION` nodes
instead.

### `CONTEXT`

Use `CONTEXT` for shared setup text that belongs to the exercise or part but is
not itself a numbered question.

Typical examples:

- a scientific setup paragraph before questions start
- instructions shared by several questions
- a short transition paragraph before a part

## Common Nesting Patterns

When the source is unambiguous, use these shapes.

These are examples, not universal law.

### Exercise-first paper

If the exercise is just a statement followed by numbered prompts:

- `EXERCISE`
- `QUESTION`
- `QUESTION`
- `QUESTION`

### Exercise split into named parts

If the exercise explicitly contains parts such as `الجزء الأول` and
`الجزء الثاني`:

- `EXERCISE`
- `PART`
- `QUESTION`
- `QUESTION`
- `PART`
- `QUESTION`

### Part-first paper

If the paper opens with top-level parts and each part contains one or more
visible exercises:

- `PART`
- `EXERCISE`
- `QUESTION`
- `QUESTION`

### Numbered question with lettered children

If one prompt contains lettered follow-ups:

- `EXERCISE`
- `QUESTION`
- `SUBQUESTION`
- `SUBQUESTION`

### Direct lettered prompts without a parent numbered question

If an exercise or part starts directly with lettered prompts:

- `EXERCISE`
- `QUESTION`
- `QUESTION`

### Shared setup before a part or question set

If a shared paragraph introduces the next grouped prompts:

- `EXERCISE`
- `CONTEXT`
- `PART`
- `QUESTION`

or:

- `EXERCISE`
- `CONTEXT`
- `QUESTION`
- `QUESTION`

### Other paper-specific shapes

If the paper shows another clear hierarchy, follow that hierarchy. Do not
rewrite the paper into a more familiar shape just because another subject or
year used it.

## Label Normalization

Keep one canonical structural label in `node.label`.
Do not duplicate the same heading in both the UI chrome and the prompt block
unless the source text truly requires it.

### Exercise labels

Use the visible heading text, normalized without trailing score text.

Examples:

- source: `التمرين الأول: (08 نقاط)`
- label: `التمرين الأول`

### Part labels

Use the visible part heading, normalized without decorative punctuation.
For Roman section headings, normalize them into Arabic ordinal part labels
because the source marker is only structural.

Examples:

- source: `الجزء الأول:`
- label: `الجزء الأول`
- source: `I -`
- label: `الجزء الأول`
- source: `II-`
- label: `الجزء الثاني`

### Question labels

Use a normalized numeric structural label.

Examples:

- `السؤال 1`
- `السؤال 2`

### Subquestion labels

Use a normalized lettered structural label.

Examples:

- `الفقرة أ`
- `الفقرة ب`

## Block Content Rules

Blocks should contain only the actual content. Structural hierarchy is handled
by nodes and labels, not repeated inside blocks.

### Put in `node.label`

- exercise heading
- part heading
- question numbering
- subquestion lettering

### Put in blocks

- the real statement text
- correction text
- hints
- rubric text
- images and other assets

Do not keep the exercise number, part number, question number, or subquestion
marker inside block text when that structure already exists in the node tree.

## Notation And Presentation Normalization

Normalize notation and block presentation when doing manual cleanup or when
reviewing automated extraction output.

### Use `paragraph` blocks for

- normal prose
- mixed prose plus inline scientific or mathematical notation
- short explanatory sentences that include values, units, ions, genes, or
  symbols inline

### Use `latex` blocks for

- standalone formulas
- reaction equations
- symbolic equalities or derivations
- formula-heavy lines that are awkward or noisy as plain prose

### Inline notation policy

Prefer inline `$...$` inside `paragraph` blocks when notation is part of a
sentence and the formatting materially affects meaning or readability.

Typical examples:

- subscripts and superscripts like `$CO_2$`, `$H_2O$`, `$10^{-3}$`
- ions and charges like `$Ca^{2+}$`, `$Cl^-$`, `$NH_3^+$`
- indexed variables or Greek-letter notation
- pH expressions like `$pH = 6.11$`
- units with powers like `$mm^3$`, `$g/mol$`

### Keep as normal prose

Do not force plain text into LaTeX just because it is scientific.

Keep these as ordinary `paragraph` content unless notation genuinely requires
formatting:

- simple numbers
- ordinary units without exponents or symbolic structure
- plain scientific names or Latin names
- ordinary prose labels that read clearly without math formatting

### Heading and readability cleanup

Use `heading` blocks for short visible labels that organize nearby content but
do not deserve their own node.

Typical examples:

- `ملاحظة`
- `الاستنتاج`
- `التعليل`

Do not use `heading` blocks for labels already represented structurally as node
labels, such as:

- exercise labels
- part labels
- question numbering
- subquestion lettering

### Punctuation and spacing cleanup

During review, clean obvious OCR or extraction noise when doing so does not
change meaning.

Good cleanup examples:

- broken spacing around punctuation
- duplicated punctuation
- malformed spacing around inline notation
- accidental line-join artifacts that make the sentence harder to read

### Avoid fake styling

Until the content model supports real inline rich text, do not simulate bold or
italic emphasis with ad-hoc markup purely for appearance.

Prefer:

- correct block splitting
- proper node labels
- proper heading blocks
- faithful inline notation

over fake markdown styling inside prose.

### Avoid when possible

- repeating `التمرين الأول` inside prompt text if it already exists as
  `node.label`
- keeping `1.` or `أ)` at the start of block text if that marker is already
  represented by the node label
- keeping score suffixes like `(08 نقاط)` in labels when the points already
  live in `maxPoints`

## Points Normalization

- exercise totals belong in `EXERCISE.maxPoints`
- part totals belong in `PART.maxPoints` only when clearly stated or safely
  inferable
- question totals belong in `QUESTION.maxPoints`
- lettered subparts belong in `SUBQUESTION.maxPoints` when they have distinct
  scoring

Do not leave score text only in rubric blocks when the node-level points are
clear enough to capture.

## Ambiguity And Non-Flattening Rules

When the source is ambiguous:

- infer the deepest structure that is actually supported by the visible paper
- do not flatten the draft just because the shape is unfamiliar
- do not invent extra hierarchy that has no real evidence in the source
- infer hierarchy from the full local context, not from letters or digits in
  isolation
- preserve visible grouping before choosing a shallower fallback
- keep shared prose in blocks rather than guessing a fake structural node
- add a review note when a hierarchy choice or point split required judgment

## Asset Rules

Until native structured assets are recovered:

- import document figures as `image`
- keep the asset attached to the node where it is used
- refine crops later if needed

## Cleanup Strategy For Earlier Drafts

This normalization can be backfilled later because:

- the DB model already supports richer nesting
- the admin inspector already supports changing node type, parent, label, and
  points

But cleanup is cheaper before mass publication.

Recommended order:

1. Use this policy for all new ingestions now.
2. Backfill the first batch of already imported drafts to match it.
3. After the data shape stabilizes, improve the web rendering so parts and
   subquestions display natively instead of being flattened.
